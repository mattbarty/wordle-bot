WordleBot is a Python-based solver for Wordle, designed to automate the solving process using advanced algorithms and web interaction via Selenium WebDriver. <br />

## Features
- **Suffix-Trie for Efficient Searching**: Implements a suffix-trie for fast, efficient word searches, optimizing the process of narrowing down potential Wordle answers.
- **Selenium WebDriver**: Automates interaction with web applications, simulating human input based on algorithmic predictions.

## Why Suffix-Trie?
The suffix-trie structure is particularly suited for Wordle's guessing game, allowing for rapid searches and updates based on partial letter information, significantly reducing the search space.

## Project Status
The project is for educational use, demonstrating data structure application and web automation in puzzle solving.

## Getting Started
Clone the repository to explore or adapt the code. Requires Selenium and a compatible WebDriver.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome to adapt the project for other uses or improve its algorithms.

## Disclaimer
This project is for educational purposes and respectful, ethical use of automation tools is encouraged.
